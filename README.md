# 🐦 Tweets Cleaning and Analysis (Beginner-Friendly)

## 📖 What Is This Project About?

This project shows how to clean and analyze tweets using Python.

Tweets usually contain:

* Links
* Mentions (@username)
* Hashtags (#topic)
* Emojis
* Extra spaces

Before analyzing tweets, we need to **clean and prepare the text**. This project walks step-by-step through that process and then explores the data to find useful insights.
